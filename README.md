## Heart Disease Prediction 
This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using machine learning models in Python. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction using popular classification algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains various health-related metrics such as:

Age

Sex

Chest pain type

Resting blood pressure

Cholesterol

Fasting blood sugar

Resting ECG results

Max heart rate achieved

Exercise-induced angina

ST depression

Slope of the ST segment

Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy

Thalassemia

Target (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease)

## Models Used
Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Performance Metrics
